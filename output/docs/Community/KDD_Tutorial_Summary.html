<h1 id="data-sketching-for-real-time-analytics-theory-and-practice">Data Sketching for Real Time Analytics: Theory and Practice</h1>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Speed, cost, and scale. These are 3 of the biggest challenges in analyzing big data. While modern data systems continue to push the boundaries of scale, the problems of speed and cost are fundamentally tied to the size of data being scanned or processed. Processing thousands of queries that each access terabytes of data with sub-second latency remains infeasible. Data sketching techniques provide means to drastically reduce this size, allowing for real-time or interactive data analysis with reduced costs but with approximate answers.</p>

<p>This tutorial covers a number of useful data sketching and sampling methods and demonstrate their use using the Apache DataSketches project[3]. We focus particularly on common analytic problems such as counting distinct items, quantiles, histograms, heavy hitters, and aggregations with large group-bys. For these, we covers algorithms, techniques, and theory that can aid both practitioners and theorists in constructing sketches and designing systems that achieve desired error guarantees. For practitioners and implementers, we show how some of these sketches can be easily instantiated using the Apache Datasketches project.</p>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

<p>This tutorial targets researchers, data systems and infrastructure engineers, and data scientists interested in greatly speeding up or reducing the cost of processing big data sets in practice. It is also useful to theory oriented CS researchers who are interested in statistical techniques that are typically outside CS curricula.</p>

<p>The audience is expected to have a familiarity of probability and statistics that is typical for an undergraduate mathematical statistics or introductory graduate machine learning course.</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p>In addition to the prerecorded presentations, the slides and Jupyter notebooks are available. Note that the KLL notebook uses an update method that is only available in release candidate v2.1.0 but as of the tutorial date is not quite available in an official release (the latest is 2.0.0).</p>

<h2 id="societal-impact">Societal Impact</h2>

<p>Our society is impacted by the ability to do fast data analysis at scale. This tutorial aims to advance this ability by demonstrating how sketching can help and by making sketching more accessible to practitioners. It is also intended to influence future research in data sketches by putting more emphasis on practical algorithms and the importance of constant factors for sketching and by introducing statistical techniques that help solve these problems.</p>
