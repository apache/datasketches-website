    <shortdesc>A library of production quality streaming algorithms with platform plugins for real-time analysis of big data in Java, C++, Python, and Go.</shortdesc>
    <description>In the analysis of big data there are often problem queries that donâ€™t scale because they require huge compute resources and time to generate exact results. Examples include count distinct, quantiles, distribution analysis, most-frequent items, joins, matrix computations, and graph analysis.

If approximate results are acceptable, there is a class of specialized algorithms, called streaming algorithms, or sketches, that can produce results orders-of magnitude faster and with mathematically proven error bounds. For interactive queries there may not be other viable alternatives, and in the case of real-time analysis, sketches are the only known solution.</description>
